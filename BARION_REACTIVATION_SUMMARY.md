# Barion Payment System Reactivation Summary

## Overview
The Barion payment system has been successfully reactivated and updated to support both test and production modes. The system now automatically detects whether to use test or production endpoints based on the POS key provided.

## Changes Made

### 1. Checkout Page (`src/app/checkout/page.tsx`)
- **Reactivated Barion payment option** in `PAYMENT_METHODS` constant
- **Added `handleBarionPayment` function** to handle Barion payment flow
- **Updated order submission logic** to handle Barion payments
- **Configured production mode** (isTestMode = false) for live payments

### 2. Barion Service (`src/lib/barion.ts`)
- **Fixed API endpoint usage** in `getPaymentState`, `finishReservation`, and `cancelPayment` methods
- **Enhanced production/test mode detection** based on POS key
- **Improved error handling** and logging

### 3. Payment Callback Handler (`src/app/api/payment/callback/route.ts`)
- **Added automatic test/production mode detection**
- **Enhanced POS key fallback logic** to use both environment variables
- **Improved logging** for better debugging

### 4. Order API (`src/app/api/orders/[orderId]/route.ts`)
- **Added PATCH method** to update orders with Barion payment ID
- **Enables order status updates** during payment flow

### 5. Barion Payment Component (`src/components/Payment/BarionPayment.tsx`)
- **Added automatic test/production mode detection**
- **Updated to use correct mode** based on POS key

### 6. Configuration (`next.config.js`)
- **Updated environment variable handling** to use actual env vars when available
- **Maintained fallback to test key** for development

## Environment Variables

### Production Setup
You need to set these environment variables on your production server (Render):

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_BARION_POS_KEY=your_production_pos_key_here
BARION_POS_KEY=your_production_pos_key_here
```

### Test Mode Detection
The system automatically detects test vs production mode:
- **Test Mode**: When POS key equals `fab5fa17-77a6-4cf6-a5ae-a5cb81e264d8`
- **Production Mode**: When any other POS key is used

## API Endpoints Used

### Test Mode
- API: `https://api.test.barion.com/v2`
- Payment: `https://secure.test.barion.com/Pay`

### Production Mode
- API: `https://api.barion.com/v2`
- Payment: `https://secure.barion.com/Pay`

## Payment Flow

1. **Customer selects Barion payment** on checkout page
2. **Order is created** in the database with PENDING status
3. **Barion payment request** is sent to Barion API
4. **Customer is redirected** to Barion payment page
5. **After payment**, customer is redirected back to success page
6. **Barion sends callback** to `/api/payment/callback`
7. **Order status is updated** based on payment result
8. **Email notification** is sent to customer (if configured)

## Testing

### Test Cards (for test mode)
- Successful payment: `4444 8888 8888 5559`
- Failed payment: `4444 8888 8888 4446`
- Low funds: `4444 8888 8888 9999`
- Lost/stolen card: `4444 8888 8888 1111`

### Test Page
Visit `/payment-test` to test the Barion integration independently.

## Security Notes

1. **POS Key Protection**: The production POS key should only be set as environment variables
2. **Callback Verification**: The callback handler verifies payment status with Barion
3. **Order Validation**: Orders are validated before payment processing

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_BARION_POS_KEY` environment variable on Render
- [ ] Set `BARION_POS_KEY` environment variable on Render  
- [ ] Verify callback URL is accessible: `https://movaga.hu/api/payment/callback`
- [ ] Test payment flow with small amount
- [ ] Monitor logs for any errors

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"POS Key not found"**: Check environment variables are set correctly
2. **"Payment start failed"**: Verify POS key is valid and active
3. **Callback not received**: Check callback URL is publicly accessible
4. **Wrong mode detected**: Verify POS key is not the test key in production

### Logging
- Callback events are logged to `logs/barion-callback.log`
- Console logs show detailed payment request/response data
- Check browser network tab for API call details

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor payment transactions** in Barion dashboard
2. **Set up email notifications** for payment confirmations
3. **Configure webhook monitoring** for callback reliability
4. **Test edge cases** (network failures, timeouts, etc.)
5. **Set up monitoring alerts** for payment failures
